      <p class="rupaul-description">Why is the queen of drag on my list? Well the whole Ru-Paul's Drag Race thing, well that was my idea
        Ru-Paul stole it from me. Bitch. Then, just to rub salt in the wound, he invited me as a guest judge
        on season 7 and when I arrived in my custom Dior gown, the bitch walked out of his dressing room and 
        and said <span class="rupaul-bold">"sike!"</span> Can you believe it!

      <p class="donald-description">Do I even need to explain this one. Just looking at this page
        in my burn book makes me feel physically sick...oh shit there's the tuna from earlier.

      <p class="harry-description">Harry Seo...do you know how often this asshole has hit me or pushed my face until I 
        look like a turkey. One day, while he's asleep, I'm going to jump on his face and smother him. I do secretly 
        love him though, but don't tell him that.

      <p class="gary-description">I have never done anything to this man but he hates me so he's going in my burn book.
        The only reason I am civil around him is to keep the peace for my gran, but wait until she's away...<span class="revenge-extra">I'll get
          my revenge!</span>

      <p class="polar-description">This is only natural. These fuckers are terrifying. I'll just be sat there minding my own business,
        then I get swiped out of existence. What did I do to deserve it? Nothing, and don't give me the whole "they need to eat" crap,
        they can also eat fish, penguins, anything other than me.

      <p class="idina-description">Defying Gravity...I hope the fuck not. That shady green bitch stole my dream. I was booked and busy with my
        best pal Kristin Chenoweth until this monster came along. I honestly hope her broom stops working...her singing isn't even that good 
        anyway. Idina, you will never be forgiven.
